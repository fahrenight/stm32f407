Hi everoyne!
I created a new github repo about embedded system and i decide to upgrade it regularly. Firstly i will start my register codes, and then STDPeriph and HAL Libraries.
1. 001_REG_SYS_CFG : About STM32F407 frequency settings with registers. We set the frequency as 168 Mhz using RCC and the other connected registers.
2. 002_REG_GPIO_LED_BUTTON: It is about a LED Blink. When you push GPIOA button, all the LEDs on the board turn on and turn of. It works according to multipl of 2. It means od and even counts.
3.
